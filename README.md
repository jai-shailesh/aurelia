# AURELIA – Luxury Perfume Branding Website

AURELIA is a modern and elegant branding website for a luxury perfume product, designed to showcase the essence of beauty and sophistication. Built using **Next.js 14**, **Tailwind CSS**, **TypeScript**, and **GSAP**, the site features smooth animations, bold typography, and a clean, component-based structure.

The design focuses on a premium visual experience with:
- A cinematic hero section featuring the perfume bottle
- A short brand story section
- An animated gallery with curated images
- A clean contact section for collecting waitlist entries

The color palette is inspired by luxury tones—rose gold and soft pink—with a focus on visual hierarchy, elegance, and performance.

Ideal for high-end product presentations and modern brand storytelling.
